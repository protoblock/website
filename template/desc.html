            Fantasy football can be frustrating. The people behind protoblock understand this and like to compair fantasy football.
            To the carer of Barry Sanders
            . Even though Barry Sanders was one of the greatest running backs of all time. Sadly he never won a super bowl.
            This is the same to
            the experts that play fantasy football. Say that you win all your games in the regular season in a typical fantasy football
            league
            you will make it to the playoffs.  But if you lose any of those games.  You win nothing most the time. Now just Image if the
            same was for Barry Sanders.  Image if we never got paid because he never won the big game.  He would have retired even sooner
            then he did.  The people behind protoblock feel that you should gegt paid even if you have dont even make the playoff.  You
            should be paid for your skills and not your luck.  Though lets not rule luck out.

                    great season that he had. 
                    You can click on each of the weeks to see what fantasy players projected for Freeman
                    and what they were awarded. This is the first part of the game. To Project what you think each player will get for fantasy points.
                    It is as simple as that.  The person's that are the closest to the correct overall fantasy stat get awarded.  So at this rate everyone
                    can have a say on what they think Freeman is worth.

                 that a fantasy player (buyer) is willing to purchase at that bid price.
                 For example, if an fantasy player (investor) wants to buy 200 contracts of Adrian Peterson at 10 per share,
                 the bid size is 200 shares. The exchange would then quote this bid size in the hundreds,
                 so the bid size for Adrian Peterson would be two.
                 If the bid size was 500 shares, the bid size quote would be five.

                 <br />
                 Bid size is the opposite of ask size. Ask size is the amount of a security that a fantasy player is offering to
                 sale. Bid size and ask size are thought to have a relationship which imply that if bid sizes are higher than ask
                 sizes, then there may be a high demand for the players stock.

                 A bid price is the price a fantasy player is willing to pay for a player.
                 This is one part of the bid with the other being the bid size, which details the amount of shares the
                 fantasy player is willing to purchase at the bid price.
                 The opposite of the bid is the ask price, which is the price a fantasy player (seller) is looking to get
                 for his or her shares of a player.

                 <b>BREAKING DOWN 'Bid Price'</b>
                 </br>
                The use of bid and ask is a fundamental part of fantasybits market system, as it details the exact amount that
                a fantasy player could buy or sell at any point in time. Remember that the current price is not the price for
                which you can purchase the player (nfl player), but the price at which the player (nfl player) shares last
                traded hands. If you want to get an idea of the price for which you can buy a nfl players security, you need to
                look at the bid and ask prices because they will often differ from the current price.

                 'Ask' is the price a fantasy player (seller) is willing to accept for a player, also known as the offer price.
                 Along with the price, the ask quote will generally also stipulate the amount of the player (nfl player) willing to be sold
                 at that price.
                 <br />
                 <b>BREAKING DOWN 'Ask'</b>
                This is the opposite of bid, which is the price a fantasy player (buyer) is willing to pay for a nfl players security,
                and the ask will always be higher than the bid. The terms "bid" and "ask" are used in nearly every financial
                market in the world covering stocks, bonds, currency and derivatives.
                An example of an ask in the fantasybit market would be $5.24 fantasybits x 1,000 which means that someone is offering to sell
                1,000 shares for $5.24 fantasy bits.

                 The ask size is the amount of a security that a market maker is offering to sell at the ask price.
                 The higher the ask size, the more supply there is that people want to sell.
                 When a fantasy player (buyer) seeks to purchase a security, he or she can accept the ask price
                 and buy up to the ask size amount at that price.
                 If the fantasy player (buyer) wishes to acquire more of the security over the current ask size,
                 he or she may have to pay a slightly higher price to the next available fantasy player (seller) .
                <br />
                <b>BREAKING DOWN 'Ask Size'</b>
                <br />
                All fantasy players are the ones who offer to buy and sell securities.
                The fantasy player must state the price it is asking for a given player (the ask price)
                and the amount it is willing to sell at that price (the ask size).
                Also, the fantasy player must state the price at which he or she is willing to buy the security (the bid price)
                and the amount of securities he or she is willing to buy (the bid size).
                When a customer order comes to the exchange, the order is filled by the fantasy player with the lowest ask price
                (for buy orders) or the highest bid price (for sell orders).
