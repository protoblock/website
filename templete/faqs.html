<h4>What is a prediction market?</h4>
<p>Prediction markets tap into the collective intelligence of crowds to forecast the outcome of events. Operating similarly to exchange-traded markets, prediction markets are created when individuals buy or sell based on what they see as the probability of an event to take place. Studies suggest that prediction markets are among the most accurate tools to forecast future events when they maintain enough trading volume and are based on profit and loss motivators – even when profit of loss isn’t tied to real currency.

<h4>What makes Trading.Football different from other sites?</h4>
