04:42 < m_jimmer> same ip
04:42 < protoblock> anyways - we need to be careful not oto assume who we are talking to. anyone can use nick jaybny through the site
04:43 < m_jimmer> register it with nickserv
04:43 < m_jimmer> should already do that on app
04:43 < protoblock> where is nick serve running?
04:44 < m_jimmer> on the ... no for public
04:44 < protoblock> would need to make users sign with keys on app for registering a FanatsyName
04:44 < m_jimmer> that is what libcommuni does
04:45 < m_jimmer> or at least is suppost to do
04:45 < protoblock> how do i register?
04:45 < m_jimmer> you cliam a name
04:45 < protoblock> no
04:45 < protoblock> i chatting as protoblock - that name is claimed and thats not me
04:46  * m_jimmer thinks that that is because you are not using app and out not logged in.  but that can be fixed

04:46 -!- protoblock is now known as clarity
04:47 < clarity> test proto
04:47 < clarity> [21:47:03] [433] clarity Nickname is already in use.
04:47 < clarity> [21:47:03] [451] You have not registered
04:47 < m_jimmer> and your point is what
04:47 < clarity> from the app - the real clarity can not chat
04:47 < clarity> im a fake clarity
04:47 < m_jimmer> at least it works unlike other things
04:47 < clarity> yes - it great
04:47 < m_jimmer> in fact that is a trending thing
04:48 < clarity> just makeing note - not to assume anything based on nick
04:48 < m_jimmer> I should fix all that you are righ
04:48 < m_jimmer> tight *
04:48 < m_jimmer> errr
04:48 < m_jimmer> right *
04:48 < clarity> no need to fix it.. its not even a bug
04:49 < clarity> its just random chat for now...
04:49 < m_jimmer> need to send auto cmd on join to server
04:49 < clarity> who controls nick server?
04:49 < m_jimmer> but need o get ssl and other up
04:49 < clarity> m_jimmer exactly not a priority
04:50 < m_jimmer> m_jimmerMain
04:50 < m_jimmer> well as of like 4 or 5 hours ago
04:50 < clarity> im working on blockchain block signer selection algo for proof-of-skill
04:50 < m_jimmer> he is the logger
04:50 < m_jimmer> cool get to it that is what i want to hear
04:51 < m_jimmer> http://protoblock.com/irclogs/Protoblock/%23protoblock.log
04:51 < clarity> ok - the way this would work would be that must sign a message when creating nick, then i guess you can generate a password - so if someone comes from the web.. any knows fantasynames cannot be used as nick...
04:51 < clarity> but again this is way int feature creep land
04:52 < m_jimmer> that is not how nickserv works
04:52 < clarity> they do somthing like that in #bitcoin-otc
04:53 < clarity> where you "auth" the nick with a signature
04:53 < clarity> "verisign" or something "clearsign"
04:53 < clarity> https://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Beginners_Guide
04:54 < clarity> https://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Beginners_Guide#Registration.2C_authentication.2C_and_validation
04:54 < m_jimmer> yeah that is just a hack
04:54 < clarity> thats gribble
04:54 < m_jimmer> look at the real old school people
04:54 < m_jimmer> gribble is a hack
04:55 < m_jimmer> look at like oftc and freenode and darknet
04:55 < m_jimmer> http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/networks/servers/
04:55 < clarity> well thats all ive used.. - fits in our case - ;;bcregister <wot name> <btc address> or ;;btcregister <wot name> <btc address> Initiate registration of a WOT name using a Bitcoin address. To complete this registration, you will need to SIGN a One Time Password (OTP) that gribble gives you (COPY THE ENTIRE TEXT including the leading "freenode:#bitco
04:55 < clarity> in-otc:" portion) and use this value with the ;;bcverify command. Bitcoin address signing is supported in the base client wallet ("Satoshi") and some other wallet software and some online wallets. The function to sign is usually found in the "Receive Coins" page. Be sure to use the same address to sign that you register with.
