			"body": "Freeman rushed for 81 yards on 24 carries and added 18 yards and a touchdown on two receptions in Sunday's loss to New Orleans. He fumbled during the game.",
			"analysis": "Freeman's fumble was especially costly as the Falcons were marching deep into Saints' territory, it was his third of the season. The second-year back scored a total of 10 touchdowns between Weeks 2 and 6, but scored just once between Weeks 7 and 14. He bounced back, finding the end zone in each of the Falcons' final three games. The version of the West Coast offense offensive coordinator Kyle Shanhan runs has produced fantasy darlings such as Arian Foster, Clinton Portis, Alfred Morris and Justin Forsett. Expect Freeman to be similarly valued in fantasy drafts ahead of next season."

			"body": "Freeman (knee) is listed as active Sunday against the Saints.",
			"analysis": "Although he's been a reliable pass-catching threat all season, garnering at least five targets in 11 of 14 games, Freeman has largely been touchdown-dependent on the ground since running for 88 yards in Week 8 against the Buccaneers. However, in his previous matchup with the Saints in Week 6, he notched 13 carries for 100 yards, eight receptions (on 10 targets) for 56 yards, and two total touchdowns."

			"headline": "",
			"body": "Freeman (knee) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Saints.",
			"analysis": "A limited participant throughout the week of practice, Freeman doesn't seem to be in any danger of missing Sunday's ideal matchup. His efficiency has waned as he season has worn on, but he should enjoy facing the New Orleans defense to close things out. Meanwhile, Tevin Coleman (concussion) has been ruled out, leaving Terron Ward as the top backup."

			"analysis": "Freeman has been diagnosed with a knee injury of unknown severity, but it didn't stop him from taking part in individual drills Wednesday. As the week unfolds, his availability for Sunday's contest against the Saints could receive some clarification, with Friday's injury report likely supplying the final word."

			"analysis": "Despite failing to top 3.5 yards per carry for the fourth straight game, Freeman scored for the second consecutive game on Sunday - barreling into the end zone on a toss to the left to open the second quarter. Prior to last week, Freeman had failed to record a rushing touchdown in six consecutive games. Atlanta seems to be feeding him the ball as much as ever now, Freeman seeing his third most and fifth most carries of the season in the past two weeks. Expect for the good times to role with Atlanta set to play a New Orleans defense next week that is ranked in the bottom of the league."

			"body": "Freeman rushed for 56 yards and a score on 25 carries and added seven catches and 45 yards through the air in Sunday's win over Jacksonville.",
			"analysis": "The touchdown snapped a six-game scoreless streak for Freeman that made his nine-touchdowns-in-five-weeks run earlier this season seem like a distant memory. Little has gone right for the Falcons in the season's second half, but Freeman's abilities as a runner and a receiver have made him a solid performer despite the team's struggles. In the seven games since the end of his touchdown streak, Freeman has topped 100 total yards four times and six catches four times. Next up is a challenge, however, as Carolina held Freeman to just 62 total yards in the teams' last matchup a week ago."

			"body": "Freeman totaled 40 yards on 12 carries and secured three of his five targets for 22 yards in Sunday's 38-0 loss to the Panthers. He also lost a fumble.",
			"analysis": "The string of impressive performances that Freeman posted earlier in the season now seem like a distant memory, with the second-year tailback failing to hit the century mark for five consecutive games. Outside of the three-carry, 43-yard tally he managed in Week 12 versus the Colts before suffering a concussion, Freeman has scuffled on the ground since an 88-yard effort in a Week 9 overtime victory over Tampa. In the other three games over that span, the 23-year-old has managed only 2.6 yards per carry, gaining 98 yards on 38 totes. Freeman's three catches Sunday also represented his second-lowest reception total of the season. With the blowout now behind them, Atlanta will try to right the ship against the Jaguars in a Week 15 road tilt."

			"analysis": "Freeman dominated the backfield touches, as Tevin Coleman rushed just three times for 13 yards. The 10 catches were a season-high and a clear indication that Freeman will get a vast majority of the RB looks in the coming weeks. Up next is a tough Week 14 trip to face the Panthers, who are tied with the Broncos for the fewest rushing yards allowed per game this season."

			"body": "Freeman (concussion) is active Sunday against the Buccaneers.",
			"analysis": "Freeman completed the concussion protocol earlier this week and was a full participant in practice Thursday and Friday, clearing the way for him to play Sunday. With Tevin Coleman failing to do much starting in place of Freeman while he was out, the latter should be in line for a heavy workload Sunday, though Tampa Bay has allowed just five rushing touchdowns this season."

			"analysis": "A limited practice participant Wednesday, Freeman returned to full sessions both Thursday and Friday. He figures to step right back in as the Falcons' bellcow, after Tevin Coleman failed to impress in his absence. Even against a tough Tampa Bay run defense, Freeman is a clear top-three option at running back in any format."
